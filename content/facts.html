        <h2>Potato Fun Facts!</h2>
        <center><img src="https://img.lcpdfr.com/uploads/monthly_2017_04/Potato.thumb.png.2ad68ffee2b867f4d68777a10d5eabd3.png" alt="small cartoon potato" height="150" /></center>
        <p align="center">Do you love potatos as much as we do? On this page you'll learn a little bit more about the potato :)</p>
        <center><h3>History</h3></center>
        <p>The potato, from the perennial Solanum tuberosum, is the world’s fourth largest food crop, following rice, wheat, and maize. The Inca Indians in Peru were the first
          to cultivate potatoes around 8,000 BC to 5,000 B.C. In 1536 Spanish Conquistadors conquered Peru, discovered the flavors of the potato, and carried them to Europe. Before
          the end of the sixteenth century, families of Basque sailors began to cultivate potatoes along the Biscay coast of northern Spain.  Sir Walter Raleigh introduced potatoes
          to Ireland in 1589 on the 40,000 acres of land near Cork. It took nearly four decades for the potato to spread to the rest of Europe.Eventually, agriculturalists in Europe
          found potatoes easier to grow and cultivate than other staple crops, such as wheat and oats. Most importantly, it became known that potatoes contained most of the vitamins
          needed for sustenance, and they could be provided to nearly 10 people for each acre of land cultivated. In the 1840s a major outbreak of potato blight, a plant disease,
          swept through Europe, wiping out the potato crop in many countries. The Irish working class lived largely on potatoes and when the blight reached Ireland, their main staple
          food disappeared. This famine left many poverty-stricken families with no choice but to struggle to survive or emigrate out of Ireland. Over the course of the famine, almost
          one million people died from starvation or disease. Another one million people left Ireland, mostly for Canada and the United States.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>An excellent source of Vitamin C</li>
          <li>Great source of Potassium!(more than a banana)</li>
          <li>Good source of vitamin B6</li>
          <li>Only 110 calories per serving</li>
        </ul>
        <center><h3>Nutrition</h3></center>
        <p>Potatoes are an excellent source of vitamin C (45% of the DV), which is more vitamin C than one medium tomato (40% DV) or sweet potato (30% DV). Vitamin C is a water-soluble
          vitamin that acts as an antioxidant stabilizing free radicals, thus helping prevent cellular damage. It aids in collagen production; assists with iron absorption; and helps 
          heal wounds and keep your gums healthy. Vitamin C may help support the body’s immune system.</p>
        <p>One medium potato with the skin contributes 2 grams of fiber or 8% of the daily value per serving. Dietary fiber is a complex carbohydrate and is the part of the plant
          material that cannot be digested and absorbed in the bloodstream. Soluble fiber may help with weight loss as it makes you feel full longer, and research has shown it also
          may help lower blood cholesterol.</p>
        <p>Potatoes are a good source of vitamin B6 with one medium potato providing 10% of the recommended daily value. Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that plays important
          roles in carbohydrate and protein metabolism. It helps the body make nonessential amino acids needed to make various body proteins; it is a cofactor for several co-enzymes
          involved in energy metabolism; and is required for the synthesis of hemoglobin – an essential component of red blood cells.</p>
        <p>One medium potato with skin provides 620 milligrams or 18% of the recommended daily value (DV) of potassium per serving and is considered one of the best foods with potassium.
          Potatoes rank highest for foods with potassium and are among the top 20 most frequently consumed raw vegetables and fruits. Potassium is a mineral that is part of every body
          cell. It helps regulate fluids and mineral balance in and out of cells and in doing so, helps maintain normal blood pressure. Potassium is also vital for transmitting nerve
          impulses or signals, and in helping muscles contract. Potassium is a powerful dietary factor that may help lower blood pressure. Unfortunately, few Americans are getting the
          recommended 4700 milligrams per day of potassium they need. (Potatoes make it easier!)</p>
